# When planning
Use ergo for all planning, so that your plans can be stored in the repo. Run "ergo --help" and "ergo quickstart" now to learn this tool.

# Project goals
- --help text (help.txt) and "ergo quickstart" output (quickstart.txt) is incredibly important because these sources are the complete manual for agents (our primary users). They seek to be:

    - 100% coverage of tool surface area
    - a great example of information design, for humans
