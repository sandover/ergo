This repository inherits global agent policy from `/Users/brandonharvey/AGENTS.md`.
Keep this file limited to ergo-specific deltas.

# Project goals
- `--help` text (`help.txt`) and `ergo quickstart` output (`quickstart.txt`) are the complete manual for agents (our primary users). They should be:
  - succinct, streamlined, fully accurate, and not redundant
  - 100% coverage of tool surface area
  - a great example of information design, for humans
