Users need clear feedback about what keys are required and smart defaults when possible.\n\n## Goal\nAt startup, detect all API keys, show status, auto-select provider when unambiguous, and provide clear instructions for missing keys.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Key Detection (before any prompts)\nCheck for:\n- FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  \n- OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n### 2. Status Display\n```\nSuperconnect v0.3.2\n  ✓ FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN\n  ✓ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n  ✗ OPENAI_API_KEY (optional)\n```\n\n### 3. Auto-Provider Selection\n- Only ANTHROPIC_API_KEY → use anthropic-agent-sdk (no prompt)\n- Only OPENAI_API_KEY → use openai-chat-completions (no prompt)\n- Both present → use toml setting, or default to Anthropic\n- Neither present → error with instructions for both\n\n### 4. Missing Key Handling\nIf FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN missing: hard error with instructions\nIf no AI key: hard error with links to get keys\n\n## Files to Modify\n- scripts/run-pipeline.js - add detectApiKeys(), showKeyStatus(), autoSelectProvider()\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Key status shown at startup before prompts\n- Single AI key auto-selects that provider silently\n- Missing Figma token shows clear error with instructions\n- Missing all AI keys shows error with links to both providers\n- When auto-selected, log which provider was chosen\n\n## Validation\n- Unset all keys → error listing all requirements\n- Set only FIGMA + ANTHROPIC → auto-selects Anthropic, logs it\n- Set only FIGMA + OPENAI → auto-selects OpenAI, logs it\n- Set all three → uses toml setting or Anthropic default","worker":"agent","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:04:29.748556Z"}}

We require Node \u003e= 22, so we can use native TS.\n\n## Implementation\n1.
